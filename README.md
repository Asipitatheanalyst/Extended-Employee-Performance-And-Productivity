## Project Overview  
This project analyzes employee performance data to uncover key workforce insights. The analysis aims to identify patterns in employee satisfaction, hiring trends, salary-performance relationships, and retention rates.  

## Data Source  
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on employees, including age, years of service, qualifications, promotions, salary, and performance metrics.  

## Tools Used  
- *Microsoft Excel* – for data cleaning, transformation, pivot tables, and visualization.  

## Data Cleaning & Preparation  
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and prepped by:  
- Removing duplicate records and irrelevant columns.  
- Handling missing values through imputation or removal.  
- Standardizing column names for consistency.  
- Converting data types where necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
EDA was performed to understand trends, distributions, and correlations. Key steps included:  
- Creating pivot tables to summarize data.  
- Visualizing distributions using charts.  
- Identifying outliers and missing patterns.  

## Objectives  
The analysis focused on answering key business questions:  
1. *Employee Satisfaction:* Evaluating overall job satisfaction.  
2. *Gender Bias:* Checking for gender disparities in hiring, promotions, and pay.  
3. *Hiring Trends:* Identifying patterns in employee recruitment over time.  
4. *Salary-Performance Correlation:* Assessing whether higher salaries correspond to better performance.  
5. *Employee Retention:* Analyzing retention rates based on experience and promotions...
